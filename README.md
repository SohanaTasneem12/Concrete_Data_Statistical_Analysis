# 🧱 Concrete Data Statistical Analysis (Descriptive Statistics + Visualizations)

This repository contains another assignment from my Business Intelligence Analyst coursework. The task focused on analyzing a dataset related to concrete compressive strength using Python. It involved statistical summary measures and multiple visualizations.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Statistics Assignment 2.pdf` – Final report with all code, plots, and interpretations
- `Statistics A2.ipynb` – Full Python code executed in Google Colab
- `Concrete_Data.xlsx` – Original dataset provided for analysis

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Descriptive Statistics for each feature:
  - Mean, Median, Mode, Range, Variance, Std. Dev, IQR, Skewness, Kurtosis
- Interpretations of each feature’s distribution
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatter Plots (Cement vs Strength, Age vs Strength, Water vs Strength)

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## 📌 Key Insights
- Age of concrete samples was highly right-skewed, with most tests done early (7–28 days)
- Fly Ash and Superplasticizer were often unused, with significant outliers when used
- Strong positive correlation observed between Age and Strength
- Negative correlation between Water content and Strength supports concrete science principles

## 📚 Objective
Apply descriptive statistical techniques and interpret real-world engineering data through Python-based visual analysis.
